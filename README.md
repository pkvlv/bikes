# Predicting Bike Sharing Demand in Seoul and D.C.

The aim of this project is to construct regression models to predict bike sharing demand. 

Two datasets are used: Seoul (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Seoul+Bike+Sharing+Demand) and D.C. (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset).

This is a project for the Spring 2023 version of the Erd≈ës Institute Data Science Bootcamp, done by Team KKL (Pavel Kovalev, Soyoung Kim).
